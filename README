This is 'bame', a binary game for the console.
It is inspired by CISCO's Binary Game (http://forums.cisco.com/CertCom/game/binary_game_page.htm).

However, you __don't__ have to:
  - input decimal numbers
  - listen to strange music
  - use flash

Build with:
make

Requirements:
ncurses

Usage:
You can set the bits of the byte you have to create with:
'a' 's' 'd' 'f' 'j' 'k' 'l' ';'
...so use us keyboard layout.
You can stop the current game with 'q'. Then 'q' again exits the game and <space> starts a new one.

Have fun!

TODO:
Use the defined mutex. I think, at least access to the ncurses window should be synchronized. Perhaps, also some global variable need synchronisation too.
