This is 'bame', a binary game for the console.
It is inspired by CISCO's Binary Game 
(http://forums.cisco.com/CertCom/game/binary_game_page.htm).

However, you __dont't__ have to:
  - input decimal numbers
  - listen to strange music
  - use flash!!!

Build with:
make

Requirements:
ncurses

Usage:
You can set the bits of the byte you have to create with:
'a' 's' 'd' 'f' 'j' 'k' 'l' ';'
...so use english keyboard layout.
You can stop current game with 'q'. Then 'q' exits game,
<space> starts new game.

Have fun!

Remark:
This is just a basic implementations with only few
lines of code. Feel free to improve and contribute.

TODO:
Use the defined mutex. I think at least access to 
the ncurses window should be syncronised. Perhaps 
also some global variable need syncronisation too.
